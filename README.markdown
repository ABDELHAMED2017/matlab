== Simple MIMO simulations

Assumes QPSK, ML decoding (except SM ZF detector).

* mrc.m - maximal ratio combining

* stc.m - Alamouti space-time block code with 1 and 2 receive antennas

* bf.m - Eigen-beamforming

* sm.m - Spatial multiplexing 2x2 (both ML decoding and suboptimal zero forcing)

== Simple OFDM simulation

Simulates guard band, cylic prefix
Preamble symbol used for channel estimation
